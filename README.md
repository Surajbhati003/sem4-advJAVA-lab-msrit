- Use Swing components to insert values and populate the table.
- Display the Customer table using JDBC.

### 9. Representative Database Application using Swing and JDBC
- Create a table named `Representative (RepNo, RepName, State, Commission, Rate)` in MySQL.
- Use Swing components to insert values and populate the table.

- Display all records of the `TShirts` table in tabular form.

## Running SQL Programs

### Adding External JAR in Build Path
For running SQL-related programs, you need to add the MySQL Connector JAR file to your build path. You can download it from [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

### Module Configuration
Make sure to include the following in your `module-info.java` file:

```java
module packageName {
    requires java.desktop;
    requires java.sql;
}
```

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-java-lab.git
   cd advanced-java-lab
   ```

2. **Set Up Database:**
   - Create the required MySQL databases and tables using the provided SQL scripts.
   - Update the database connection details in the respective Java files.

3. **Compile and Run:**
   - Use your IDE (such as Eclipse) to compile and run the Java programs.
   - Ensure you have added the MySQL Connector JAR to your project build path.

4. **Deploy JSP and Servlet:**
   - Deploy the JSP and Servlet code on a web server (like Apache Tomcat).
